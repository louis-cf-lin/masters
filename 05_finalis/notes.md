# Writing notes

- Talk about stuff that were done
- Usually longer than published papers
- Include progress and evidence of work + research
- Bullet point main chapters
- What is being communicated?
- Start with placeholder images
  - Or what plots do I need to support certains claims?
- Mindmap
- Things to talk about:
  - Evolving artificial chemistry
    - Selection
    - Variation/Mutation mechanisms
    - Based on microbial genetic algorithm
  - Evolutionary/Genetic algorithm
    - Why genome to phenome mapping wasn't used
  - Action selection
  - Differential wheeled robot
    - Kinematics
    - Motion
    - Trajectory
  - Energy, entropy, and information
  - Discrete environment
    - First experimentation
    - "Grid" movement
  - Deriving reaction rates
    - Evolving favoured rate
    - Explaining ¬□(favoured = forward)
  - Papers that were reproduced
    - Evolution of associative learning in chemical networks (McGregor et al.)
    - A minimal model of metabolism-based chemotaxis (Egbert et al.)
    - Behavioural metabolution: the adaptive and evolutionary potential of metabolism-based chemotaxis (Egbert et al.)
    - The microbial genetic algorithm (Harvey)
    - Evolving action selection and selective attention without actions, attention, or selection (Seth)
  - Explaining the architecture
    - Controller (chemical network), reactions, chemicals
    - Environment, objects, consumables, traps
    - Agent, sensorimotor links, omnidirectional sensors
- Say everything three times (fractal)
  - Whole dissertation (intro)
  - Middle (explain it)
  - Conclusion (say it again)
