# Questions

## 24 March 2021

1. All variables initialised at 0.05

 Correct

2. 2.5 million iterations but Figure 6 shows it as mid way

 Just a typo

3. Is C concentration correct? (page 6 says typically range between 0 and 2 but peaks at 10)

 That's fine

4. The probability of tumbling is too low to remain at areas of high M and E; even when visiting highly desirable areas, bacteria doesn't stay there at all

 Distribution - cannot tell from an individual bacterium's path

5. Do concentrations (variables in square brackets) need to be normalised or something?

 No

 ### Tasks

Associative learning chemical networks (McGregor) - summarise it

1. Assuming dt = 0.01?

 

- Assuming dt = 0.01?
- Assuming initial values are all 0 except for c=0.5 and h=1?


Autocatalytic reactions could be a form of memory where, once a bacteria is exposed to an element, it allows the autocatalytic reaction to occur
But this isn't scalable - you'd need an element for every unique combination of reactants

What sort of ODE's would allow a bacterium to escape a local optimum?
  - Random chance of performing antichemotaxis
  - Bacterium leaves behind "waste" products that are toxic
  - Local resources deplete
  - Prey and predator model
2. Assuming initial values are all 0 except for c=0.5 and h=1?


Feel free to play around with the numbers
 - No squaring in tumble prob
 - Adjusting the 0.001
 - Plot it and show again
